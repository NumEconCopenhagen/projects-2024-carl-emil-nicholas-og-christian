# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Rolling the DICE in metaanalysis** and is about determining the functional form of the damage function in nobel laureant William D. Nordhaus's new 2023-version of the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model (DICE).

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Nordhaus' data.csv (*source*) 
1. Tol's.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
