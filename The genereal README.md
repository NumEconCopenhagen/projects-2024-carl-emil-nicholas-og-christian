# An overview of our projects

**Christian Skinh√∏j (fzw199), Nicholas Hitchcock (tgj939) and Carl Emil Lauridsen (hqg927):**

This repository contains the following 4 projcets:

**1. Inaugural project.**

In this project, we analyze an exchange economy model with two consumers (A and B) and two goods (x1 and x2). We begin by illustrating the set of Pareto improvements in an Edgeworth box and proceed to solve various optimization problems to find market-clearing prices and allocations that maximize utility under different constraints. Finally, we consider random initial endowments and analyze the resulting market equilibrium allocations.

**2. Data project**

The project is named "A metaanalysis of the damage function in the DICE-23 model" and is inspired by our bachelor project. Our data consist of two metaanalysis from William Nordhaus and Richard Tol that combines 83 studies looking at the effect of increases in the global mean temperature on the world economy's output. We evaluate the functional form of the damage function based on a linear and quadratic regression of the datapoints from the combined datapoints of the two metaanalysis.

**3. Model project**

We analyze the effect of technological growth and parametization of the savings rate in the Solow model by making an extenstion of the basic Solow model that allows for technological growth. We solve both the standard and extended model analytically and confirm the solution numerically using an algorithm. Furhtermore, we illustrate the solution and a simulation of the model graphically.

**4. Exam project**

This projcet solves 3 seperate problems. 
- In the first problem we check the market clearing condition for an economy with 2 goods markets an 1 labor market with 2 producers and 1 representive consumer, find the equilibrium price set and solve for the optimal taxation and lump sump transfer in the present of a CO2 externality.
- In the second problem we simulate a career choice model with 3 different career choices with changing assumptions about the known and unknown part of the payoff when working. We look at the share of graduates choosing each career, switching careers when allowed and a shift cost is introdcued and when the decisions are based on insigts from a varying number of friends working in the careers.
- In the third and final problem we look at barycentric interplotation to analyze a given function.
