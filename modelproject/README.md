# Model analysis project

**Note:** the model project was due same week as our bachelor thesis. Therefore, we plan to go back and improve this model project after having defended our bachelor thesis and before the exam. We hope you still find the project at a sufficient level to pass, with the promise that we will improve it later.

Our project is titled **Natural resources in the Solow model** and is about the effect on the capital accumlation and the capital/output-ration of introducing nautral resources in the neo-classic growth model (Solow). The project shows a convergence of the capital-output ratio towards a steady state of 5 when taking nautral resources into account. This represents an increase in the capital-output level over time, similar to the predictions of Thomas Piketty.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
