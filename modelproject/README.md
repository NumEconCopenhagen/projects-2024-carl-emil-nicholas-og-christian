# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **An analysis of tehcnological growth in the Solow model** and is a comparative analysis of a solow model with and without technological growth. Thus, our baseline model has no technological growth and normalize technology to 1 in the production, while our extended model introduces technology (A) as part of the production function and allow for technological growth over time. We find that technological growth yields a higher level of output through an increase in the producitivity of both labor and capital. In addition we analyze the effect of the savings rate on the capital-labor-ratio by variating the savingsrate between 10%-40%. Here we find an increase in the savings rate from 10%-40% increases the capital-labor-ratio by a factor of 8 throughout 100 periods. This results in a significantly higher GDP/capita as found in our analytical derivation of the steady state level of y*. Thus, the analysis confirms that countries with high saving rates and technological growth will have higher living standards as measured by GDP/capita.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
