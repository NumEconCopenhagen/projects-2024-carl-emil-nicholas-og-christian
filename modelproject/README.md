# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Natural resources in the Solow model** and is about the effect on the capital accumlation and the capital/output-ration of introducing nautral resources in the neo-classic growth model (Solow).

The **results (showing a convergence of the capital-output ratio towards a steady state of 5)** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
