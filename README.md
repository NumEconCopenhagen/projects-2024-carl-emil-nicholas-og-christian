This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project: "A metaanalysis of the damage function in the DICE-23 model". Our data consist of two metaanalysis from William Nordhaus and Richard Tol that combines 83 studies looking at the effect of increases in the global mean temperature on the world economy's output. We evaluate the functional form of the damage function based on a linear and quadratic regression of the datapoints from the combined datapoints of the two metaanalysis.
3. Model project. We analyze the effect of technological growth and parametization of the savings rate in the Solow model by making an extenstion of the basic Solow model that allows for technological growth.
